# Rover BMS Simulation Personal Project
Created by: Tianna Sequeira
Date: January 2026

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to simulate a Battery Management System (BMS) for a rover, capable of transitioning between operational states based on sensor inputs and environmental conditions. The system monitors battery health and enforces safe operating limits while managing charge and discharge behavior.

This project is relevant to automotive and aerospace applications, where autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles must adapt to changing environments while maintaining energy efficiency, safety, and system reliability.

### Requirements:
- Monitor battery voltage, current and temperature
- Implement state-based logic for charging, discharging, idle, and fault conditions
- Communicate with embedded hardware or simulated systems
- Implement control algorithms for battery charging and discharging
- Integrate automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery
- Support model-based design and code generation workflows

## Software Used:
- Simulink | Model-based Design and control algorithm simulation
- Embedded C | Core BMS Logic and Control Implementation
- Bazel | Build System for compipling embedded code and managing dependencies
- RTOS | Task scheduling, timing, and real-time behaviour simulation
- Git | Version control and collaborative development
- GitLab CI/CD | Automated build, test and deployment piplines
- Google Test | Unit and integration testing framework
- CAN | Communication between BMS and other subsystems

## Skills Learned:
- Embedded C Programming
- Model-Based Design
- CI/CD Piplines
- Communication Protocols
- Testing (Software, Unit and Integration)
